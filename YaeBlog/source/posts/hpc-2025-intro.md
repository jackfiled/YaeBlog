> High Throughput Computing: Resource utilization efficiency.

High performance computing:

- Provide computer power.
- Full-Domain HPC = Full-Stack HPC + Full-Network HPC.

Two key weapons: **partitioning** and **duplicating** to increase granularity.

HPC History:

- Mainframe computer
- Mini computer
- Cluster
- Grids
- Clouds
